To find the string length:

(0) Save the starting address of the string (address of the first byte)
(1) Find the address of null byte (address of the last byte)
(2) length = address_of_the_last_byte - address_of_the_first_byte

x86 instruction:
(1) use the scan string instruction, mnemonic : scas(b|w|d|q)
(2) we will use the byte version - scasb
(3) use the 'repne' prefix with scasb to perform the task until the null byte is found.
